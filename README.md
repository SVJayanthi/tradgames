# Code for AI for Traditional Games Spring 2015

There are four programs in this repository:

1. GameMaster - A Java program that controls the interactions between agents and a moderator running the game.

2. AgentTester - A Java program that runs one agent in isolation and helps with visualizing the game state.

3. ChineseCheckersModerator - A C++ program that validates moves and moderates the play of a game of Chinese Checkers

4. ChineseCheckersRandom - A C++ program that plays a game of Chinese Checkers by taking each move randomly.

Additionally there are various partial agent implementations to play Chinese Checkers.

## GameMaster
GameMaster is a Java programs that controls the interactions between agents and a master running the game.
It has both a command line interface and a graphical user interface.

### GUI
The source code for the GUI version is at GameMaster/gui with the main class being named GameMaster.

The GameMaster GUI version is a swing GUI to control running a game.

It requires Java 8 to run.

### Command line interface
The source for the command line interface version is at GameMaster/cli.

To start a game between two random players type the following:

    java GameMaster -1 'path/to/breakthrough_random player1' -2 'path/to/breakthrough_random player2' -m 'path/to/breakthrough'

Alternatively, the game setup can be stored in a response file like

    --player1=path/to/breakthrough_random player1
    --player2=path/to/breakthrough_random player2
    --master=path/to/breakthrough

It can then be loaded like:

    java GameMaster @response_file_name

A sample response file is included named Random.vs.Random.txt.

Running GameMaster with the argument `--help` will display the full set of options that the program supports.

## AgentTester
The source code for AgentTester is at GameMaster/gui with the main class being named AgentTester.

AgentTester is a Java Swing GUI to make debugging you agent easier.

It requires Java 8 to run.

To use:
1. Select the type agent you have from the combo box in the upper left corner. Use
   "Binary" if you are using C++, and "Java" if you are using Java.
2. Press the Browse and navigate to your executable, or main class (Main.class if
   you used the starting Java code).
3. Press the "Start" button. This will launch a new instance of your agent.

At this point you can send commands by typing in the textfield at the bottom of the
window and either pressing enter or the "Send" button.

If you wish to view the state of the board, press the "Refresh Board" button. This
will send the DUMPSTATE and LISTMOVES commands to your agent and graphically show
the results on the gameboard.

When there is a board displayed, hovering over the pieces of the player whose turn
it is will highlight the moves reported by the LISTMOVES command. If you click on
the source piece and then its destination, the input box at the bottom of the screen
will be populated by the corresponding MOVE command for that move.

Finally, when AgentTester launches an agent, it does this in a new process each time
(and separate VM for Java). Because of this, you should be able to leave AgentTester
open, recompile in your IDE, then stop and restart the agent in AgentTester and get
the new version.


## ChineseCheckersModerator
ChineseCheckersModerator is a C++ program that validates moves and moderates the play of a game of Chinese Checkers.
It is responsible for the following tasks:
* Tracking the players in the game
* Ensuring all played moves are valid
* Ensuring that a move is played within the required time limit
* Ensuring that a player does not play out of turn
* Determining when a game is over

### Command line options
#### `--quiet`
This option will silence the printing of the board every move. The
GameMaster GUI relies upon this output, so this option should really
only be used when running the moderator directly.

This option is off by default.

#### `--enforce TIME`
This option will put an enforced time limit per move. The parameter
`TIME` is interpreted as a floating point number. The game will not be
stopped at the time limit, but after a too slow move is played, the
game will be called against the slow player.

This option is off by default.

## Communication Protocol
All communication between agents and the moderator will use only `std::cin` and `std::cout` (`stdin` and `stdout` in C and `System.in` and `System.out` in Java).
You may freely write to `std::cerr` if you wish to have debugging output (`stderr` in C and `System.err` in Java).
Anything written to `std::cout` will be considered a command.
Any invalid command will result in forfeiting the game.

There are two types of commands: GameMaster commands and game commands.

### GameMaster commands
GameMaster commands are generic non-game commands related to setting up a game to play. All of these commands can be sent by an agent. Only the `#quit` command will be sent to an agent.

#### `#getname ID`
Returns the name of player with ID.
#### `#moderator`
Registers the agent as a moderator. It will receive all messages and broadcasts must be qualified by their recipient. It is intended for use only by the ChineseCheckersModerator
#### `#name NAME`
Declares the current agent to be named NAME. No spaces are allowed. The names `moderator` and `observer` are reserved.
#### `#players`
Returns the number of connected players.
#### `#quit`
Immediately terminates the game. This message is always broadcast to all clients.

### Game commands
An agent must be able to respond to all of the commands below. Only the `MOVE` command should be sent by an agent.

#### `BEGIN CHINESECHECKERS player1 player2`
Starts a new game with player1 starting first.
The names player1 and player2 will be replaced with the names provided to the moderator with the `#name` command.

#### `FINAL winner BEATS loser`
Declares the game over with the winner and loser specified.
As with `BEGIN`, the names declared by the `#name` command will be used in place of winner and loser.

#### `MOVE from_location TO to_location`
Moves the piece at `from_location` to `to_location`.
An agent will receive this command to indicate an opponents move.
An agent will send this command to indicate their move.
A location is specified as a single integer ranging from 0 to 80, as in the above image.

#### `UNDO from_location TO to_location`
Undoes the effects of a `MOVE from_location TO to_location` command.

This command needs to only be supported prior to the first call of the `BEGIN` command.


#### `LISTMOVES`
Directs the agent to list all the valid moves for the current board state. A move will be formatted as `from, to` with a comma between `from` and `to` semi-colons between moves. The order of the moves may vary. For example, the valid moves at the beginning of the game are

    2, 4; 2, 20; 3, 4; 3, 12; 10, 12; 10, 28; 11, 12; 11, 20; 18, 20; 18, 36; 19, 20; 19, 28; 27, 28; 27, 36;

This command needs to only be supported prior to the first call of the `BEGIN` command.

#### `NEXTMOVE`
Prints out the next move the agent would play given the current board state.
A move will be formatted as `from, to` with a command between `from` and `to`.
For example, this command may return

    2, 4

This command needs to only be supported prior to the first call of the `BEGIN` command.

### `EVAL`
Prints out the current state evaluated with respect to the current player. The output will be on one line and treated as a string by the tools. Practically this should be a number.

This command needs to only be supported prior to the first call of the `BEGIN` command.

#### `DUMPSTATE`
Directs the agent to print out the current game state.
The format is the digit 1 or 2 indicating whose turn it is, followed by a space, followed by 81 integers valued 0, 1, or 2, indicating an empty square, a place occupied by player 1, or a place occupied by player 2. For example, the state prior to the game starting should be:

    1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2

This corresponds to the board position:
![Board](board.png)

This command needs to only be supported prior to the first call of the `BEGIN` command.

#### `LOADSTATE new_state`
Directs the agent to load new_state as the current state. The format is identical to that of `DUMPSTATE`.

This command needs to only be supported prior to the first call of the `BEGIN` command.

## Your program
When your program starts is must immediately register using the `#name` command.
It will then wait for the `BEGIN` command to start a game.
Prior to a game starting, your agent should correctly respond to `LOADSTATE`, `DUMPSTATE`, `LISTMOVES`, `EVAL`, `NEXTMOVE`, and the `MOVE` command which will immediately call the apply moves.
The purpose of handling these commands prior to a game beginning to allow for automated testing of your agent's handling of the game state.
They are most easily accessed using the AgentTester tool.


## Sample Agents
There are two sample agent implementations in the `SampleAgents` directory in C++, and Java.
These provide a very bare framework to show how an agent should be communicating.

Additionally there are two partial Chinese Checkers agents, again in C++ and Java, in the `PartialChineseCheckers` directory. These agents play the game correctly, and speak the above communication protocol, however they do not know how to play jump moves. There are also many design decisions inside the state representation that were made for code clarity instead of efficiency. Improving this will make an agent stronger.

Finally, when compiling the Moderator project, a ChineseCheckersRandom program will be created. This agent will play all of the rules of Chinese Checkers and it speaks the above communication protocol, but its move selection is uniformly random among all of its options. If at least one command line parameter is passed, the first will be used as the agent's name instead of the default "Random".

## Compiling Everything
### GameMaster GUI
The GameMaster GUI can be build as simply as `javac GameMaster.java` in the appropriate directory.

Additionally in the GameMaster/gui directory there is a makefile which will build the GameMaster GUI and the AgentTester and package them in jar files.

### AgentTester
The AgentTester can be build as simply as `javac GameMaster.java` in the appropriate directory.

Additionally in the GameMaster/gui directory there is a makefile which will build the GameMaster GUI and the AgentTester and package them in jar files.


### ChineseCheckersModerator and ChineseCheckersRandom
Since these programs are in C++, the build process is operating system dependent.

If you are using Linux, use CMake. Create a new build directory, then in a terminal execute `cmake path/to/Moderator; make`. Alternatively the provided makefile should also work.

If you are using OSX, you can either use CMake or the provided makefile.

If you are using Windows, you can either use the provided solution file in Moderator/VS2013 or use CMake to generate Visual Studio solution file or see Canvas for pre-built executables.

If there are any problems compiling, please contact Will.

## Using this code to play other games
Most of the code can be reused for other games. The GameMaster GUI only has a dependence of the game played in the HexGameBoard class, which is currently for Chinese Checkers, which is a generic type within the GameMasterGUI class. The remainder of the GUI has no knowledge of the game played, or its representation, or its commands. The moderator program would need to be ported by writing a state class for the new game. Currently the moderator and random agent are templated and should have minimal dependence on the game played.
